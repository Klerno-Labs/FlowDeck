# Missing Product Images - Action Required

## CRITICAL: Images Currently Broken in App

### INVICTA Brand (5 products) - BROKEN IMAGE LINKS

These products point to files that **DON'T EXIST**:

| Product | Current Path (BROKEN) |
|---------|----------------------|
| INVICTA AB Series | /images/products/invicta/ab_series_SOE_222_full_B&W.png ❌ |
| INVICTA AB500 Series | /images/products/invicta/ab500_series_pair_full_B&W.png ❌ |

| Invicta Filter Vessels | /images/products/vessels/invicta_vessels_B&W.png ❌ |

**What exists in invicta folder:**
- invicta_banner.jpg (300 KB)
- invicta_vessel_features.png (666 KB)
- invicta_vessel_inside.png (1.4 MB)
- invicta_vessel_side.png (1008 KB)

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: Hide INVICTA Products

Since you said "if we dont have images please dont have them on the app", I should:

**Option 1:** Set their image_path to NULL (they won't show in app)
**Option 2:** Delete these products from database temporarily
**Option 3:** Get proper INVICTA images and add them

**Which would you prefer?**

## Other Products Needing Images

### SIEVA 600 HT Series
- Product exists in database
- **No image file found anywhere** ❌
